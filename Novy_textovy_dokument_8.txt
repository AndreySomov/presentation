in preparation for this presentation, I tried to answer a few questions for myself

What is machine learning?
How do we train machines?
How is this method different from others?
How can we use machine learning?
What to expect from machine learning in the future?

1. What is machine learning?


Look at these people, can you determine their age?

Machine learning is one of the areas of artificial intelligence. The basic principle is that machine learning systems allow you to quickly apply the knowledge gained during 'learning' on large data sets and then, solve tasks that are natural intelligence carriers that are not difficult, such as face recognition, speech recognition, object recognition , translation, and many others, but represent a problem for algorithms based on a programmed set of rules. Currently it is the most promising business tool based on artificial intelligence.


3. How do machines learn?


Let's look at a example of how machine learning is applied in practice.
Imagine that our company sells killer robots. 
we also have a website where we sell our robots and get feedback
We want to understand what people write about our product in social networks.



First we need to get a training sample. In our case, it will be comments from our site, and users feedback. Each comment will be denoted as 'x' and a rating of this comment as 'y'


And we have our own website where people buy robots and leave feedback on their use. 


For example, we'll take 2 comments with brightly-played tonalities from ours training sample.


Thank you very much! This is exactly what I was looking for, the quality is excellent! My neighbors will no longer bother me. The only negative is that it burned the floor of the area, with my house too.


Terrible quality! All the Gypsies of the camp were thrown off to him, but he does not understand that we order him, I advise you to avoid this manufacturer. Money back and thanks for that!



Hard to find a formula to solve this problem. So will have to simplify the task. Let's write with you a bag of words. This are the 1000 most important in our opinion words that can characterize the comment:

 1. very     (1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ... 0)
 2. thanks    (0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, ... 0)
 3. excellent (0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, ... 0)
 4. avoid    (0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, ... 0)
 5. terrible    (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, ... 0)
 6. ...
 1000. negative    (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ... 1)

Each word will have its own coding of 1000 numbers.
Find all the words in the text, add their encodings, and get the encoding of our commentary consisting of 1000 numbers as well.

First review (1 (great), 1 (thanks), 1 (excellent), 0, 0, 0, ... 1 (minus))
Second review (0, 1 (thanks), 0, 1 (broke), 1 (avoid), 1 (terrible) ... 0))


Then we need to apply weights to our selectors:



a (x) = 2*(very) + 4*(thanks) + 5*(excellent) - 3*(minus) = 8

a (x) = 4*(thanks) - 4*(avoid) - 5*(terrible) = -5




We discard the number and take the sign to get + or - at the output, this will characterize the result of the work of our model as + or -.

3.Loss function:

But how do we know that weights are correct with our selector?


for example: why does the word 'thanks' have a weight of 4 rather than 5?


To determine how true the model is used a loss function.
It will show us how much the result of our model applied to the comments differs from the real user rating.


I will not delve into the mathematical aspects of the loss function, because we don't have much time.
But it's important to consider that each task requires a suitable loss function. And for specific tasks you need to create your own loss function.


The most popular loss functions:
Simple
Quadratic
Rectangular
Exponential(loss function with saturation)

In our case we will use simple, and popular quadratic loss function.
We will take the assessment of the comment that our model has given, and then compare it with the assessment that the user has set.Then we can get comments from social networks that no longer have a specific user rating, and apply our model to them.


Types of machine learning:


Supervised learning: In the example above, we used this approach. We customize our model so that its results coincide with the results of the training sample.


Unsupervised learning: The machine does not learn from selected data. The point is that among the data there is no "correct" answer, the machine must find a relationship between the objects and divide them into groups. In our example, we would immediately take comments from social networks, drive through the model, and at the output we would receive groups of comments with certain signs, then we would need to tell the model which of them to be positive and which to negative.


Reinforcement learning: The machine learns through a reward-based system.

2.How is this method different from others?

В отличие от программ с закодированными вручную инструкциями для выполнения конкретных задач, машинное обучение позволяет системе научиться самостоятельно распознавать шаблоны и делать прогнозы.

3. Application of machine learning:

Transport: autopilots in cars.
Health care: predicting patient diagnoses for doctors
Social Network: Dating Compatibility Prediction
Finance: Credit Card Fraud Prediction
E-commerce: forecasting customer churn, product recommendations
Biology: search for patterns of gene mutations that can cause cancer
